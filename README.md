This project was the first test of my knowledge on Supervised Machine Learnng (Linear Regression).

The aim is to train the model to minimize the error value between the predicted and actual values in the test dataset. This trained model will be utilized to predict the academic performance of prospective students.

The results will assist the school in determining the viability of admitting academically strong performers, based on the parameters provided to the model.
